# ATutor SQL Injection
## SQL Injection
In order to examine and study the CVE-2017-1000004 vulnerability, a brief explanation of a SQL Injection Attack is required. 

Any web application that takes user input is vulnerable. SQL injection or SQLi is an injection attack where the attacker can execute malicious SQL statements in the user input that controls the database server behind the web application. In 2017 SQLI was rated the number one attack on the OWASP top ten[1][1]. It usually allows the attacker to examine data that they are not normally able to view, this includes data that belongs to other users.

In many SQL injection attacks, the attacker can spoof identity,  gain unauthorized access to sensitive data such as passwords, personal user information or credit card information, modify (insert/update/delete) data or execute administrative operations causing permanent adjustments to the web application's content or performance [2][2][3][3].
